# Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes.
#
# Rules :
#   - Start with a capital letter.
#   - Use 'Fix', 'Add' or 'Change' to start your subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#
# Example :
#   Change 'lastmod' datetime format in sitemap output
#
# Subject maximum length
#------------------------------------------------>


# Leave one blank line before and after

# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
# line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
# the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
# two together.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#  - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
#    single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary
#
# Example :
#   The custom code who implement hook_simple_sitemap_arbitrary_links_alter() use datetime format ISO8601 output
#   2018-06-11T15:21:57+0200 which is not a valid format for site map standard. ISO8601 use 'Y-m-dTH:i:sO' format
#   against W3C format 'Y-m-dTH:i:sP'.
#
#   After applied this commit, the following things must to do :
#     1. Regenerate the XML sitemap from administration interface
#     2. Flush HTTP caching to provide the new valid site map
#
# Body maximum length
